It's an application prototype of a modern digitized public transportation system using QR codes. It is meant as a test of an alternative approach of using public transport, eliminating the dependency on using physical cards as a form of payment in favor of an e-wallet system. A reward, e-commerce type system can also be implemented, acting as an incentive for the public to favor public transportation to their own private vehicles. The goal of a final implemented version of this idea is a public transport system that is more accessible and offers incentives to make the use of public tranportation more common.
